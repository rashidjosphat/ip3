# Detailed Explanation of the Setup Process
## Prerequisites

This section provides an overview of the tools needed to run the application:

    Vagrant: A tool for building and managing virtualized development environments.
    VirtualBox: A free and open-source hypervisor for x86 virtualization.
    Ansible: An open-source automation tool for software provisioning, configuration management,
    and application deployment.
    Terraform: An infrastructure as code tool that allows you to define and provision data center
    infrastructure using a declarative configuration language.

## Initializing the Application

    Navigating to the Directory:
        Make sure you are in the stage-two directory where all the configuration files are located.

    Terraform Commands Explained:
        The command you run initiates the Terraform process:
            terraform plan -out=tfplan: This creates an execution plan and saves it to tfplan.
            terraform apply -auto-approve tfplan: This applies the saved plan automatically,
            without requiring manual approval.

## Accessing the Application

After successful execution of the Terraform commands, the application will be available at http://localhost:3000. You should see the homepage of your e-commerce platform.
